<h3> Instructions 3/3 </h3>
<h5>Please read the instructions carefully! </h5>

    <p> <strong>In each round, you can gain or lose points.
        </strong> 
    </p>
    <p> <b> At the end of the study, one round will be randomly drawn.</b> The outcome from this round  will decide your bonus payment and the environmental outcome. The carbon emissions from that
        round will be realized. The points you gained or lost in that round will be converted into British Pounds
        (conversion rate: 200 points &#8793; £1) and will be added to your initial bonus payment of £1. Note that your bonus
        payment is never negative. The minimum bonus payment you can get is £0. </p>
</div>

<div>

        <b>Example:</b> Imagine you played 2 rounds. In round 1, you lost 100 points and the carbon emissions were 10 pounds.
        In round 2, you gained 50 points and carbon emissions were zero.
        At the end, the computer will draw randomly either round 1 or round 2. If round 1 is drawn, your payoff will be
        -100 points, divided by 200 = -£0.5. Your bonus payment will then be £1 (initial endowment) -£0.5 = £0.5 (equal to around USD $0.62). The carbon emissions of 10 lbs will be realized by selling a CO2 certificate
        that allows the buyer to emit 10 lbs of CO2.
